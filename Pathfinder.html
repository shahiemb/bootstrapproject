    <h5>Forward Scout</h5>
    <p>Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile eNtity) modified to specialize in location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an abandoned warehouse with no idea who created him or why.&nbsp;With only his MRVN designation to hint at his identity, Pathfinder eventually set off in search of his creator.<br>
    </p>
    
        
           <p>Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew) but hasn’t come any closer to finding his creator. Still, he’s never given up hope, and has joined the Apex Games to gain a following--and hopefully draw the attention of his maker. In the meantime, he remains enthusiastic and helpful, always ready to make new friends (then shoot them).<br>
